# MailMerge
The 'Mail Merge' project aims to develop a robust and efficient mail merge method. This method will take as input a template text file, process it to identify specially marked-up text blocks, replace these blocks with corresponding data entries retrieved from an XML file, and ultimately generate output files containing the substituted text.
